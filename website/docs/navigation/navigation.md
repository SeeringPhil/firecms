FireCMS takes care of the navigation for you, it generates routes and menus based
on the configuration that you set up.

:::tip
The collections can be defined asynchronously, so you can fetch data from your backend
to build them.
It might be useful if you want to build the collections based on the logged-in user,
or if you want to fetch some data to build the schema of your collections.
Check the [dynamic collections](../collections/dynamic_collections.md) section for more information.
:::

You have two main ways of creating the top level views in FireCMS, either creating entity
collections that get mapped to CMS views, or create your own top level React views.

:::note
Check all the possible configurations for defining [collections](../collections/collections.md)
:::

Otherwise, you can define your own [custom top level views](./custom_top_level_views.mdx).
