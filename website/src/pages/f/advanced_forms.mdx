# Fields and forms customization

Depending on your business logic, you might be fine with using the default
fields provided by FireCMS. We include around **20 fields** that should cover most
of your needs. Ranging from simple text fields or selects to complex ones like
file uploaders, date pickers or reference fields, we cover all the basic use cases.
We also provide hundreds of validation options and the ability to create
custom validators.

But sometimes, you might need to create a more complex editing form and create
specific fields that are not covered by the default ones. In this case, you can
create your own custom fields and use them in your entity collection.

## Custom fields to fit your needs

[MedicalMotion](https://www.medicalmotion.com/) is a platform that generates
customised physiotherapy treatments.
The exercises are created by the physical therapists and then assigned to their
patients using AI. The exercises collection is managed by the internal team
using FireCMS.

Let's see how MedicalMotion uses the same body selection component
that end users see, in their backend admin panel.

:::info Reusable components
There are multiple benefits for **keeping consistency** between the different
components of the platform. For example, the exercises are used in the
physiotherapy treatments, but also in the patient's dashboard.
:::

Each exercise affects different body parts and the physical therapist can
choose which body parts are affected by the exercise. This could be
resolved by using a simple select field, but we wanted to make it more
interactive and show the user a preview of the body part affected by the
exercise.

The field is stored as a simple **array of strings** in the database, but we
wanted to show the user a preview of the body part affected by the exercise:

```
bodyParts: ["shoulder", "elbow"]
```

This is how the affected body parts of an exercise field works:

<video style={{maxWidth: "100%", margin: "16px 0px 32px", alignSelf: "center"}}
       loop autoPlay muted>
    <source src="/img/custom_fields_dark_wide.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

The field is defined as a Component that receives `FieldProps` as a prop, and
then assigned to the entity collection.

You can check more details about how this is implemented
in [Custom fields](/docs/properties/custom_fields).

## Fine grained permissions

MedicalMotion also uses FireCMS to manage their **users and permissions**. They
have a complex permission system that allows them to define permissions at
different levels:

- Collection level
- Entity level
- Property level

This is achieved by using a Firestore collection that stores the users and
the roles assigned to them. The roles are defined as a simple array of strings
that are used to check if the user has permission to perform an action.

```
roles: ["admin", "editor"]
```

Each role define which actions can be performed on the collection, entity or
property. For example, the `admin` role can perform any action on the
collection, while the `editor` role can only perform `read` and `update`.

Also, specific roles are used for content managers or physiotherapists.
Physiotherapists can only edit the exercises assigned to them, while admins
can review and edit all the exercises.
